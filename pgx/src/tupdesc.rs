/// This struct is passed around within the backend to describe the structure
/// of tuples.  For tuples coming from on-disk relations, the information is
/// collected from the pg_attribute, pg_attrdef, and pg_constraint catalogs.
/// Transient row types (such as the result of a join query) have anonymous
/// TupleDesc structs that generally omit any constraint info; therefore the
/// structure is designed to let the constraints be omitted efficiently.
///
/// Note that only user attributes, not system attributes, are mentioned in
/// TupleDesc; with the exception that tdhasoid indicates if OID is present.
///
/// If the tupdesc is known to correspond to a named rowtype (such as a table's
/// rowtype) then tdtypeid identifies that type and tdtypmod is -1.  Otherwise
/// tdtypeid is RECORDOID, and tdtypmod can be either -1 for a fully anonymous
/// row type, or a value >= 0 to allow the rowtype to be looked up in the
/// typcache.c type cache.
///
/// Note that tdtypeid is never the OID of a domain over composite, even if
/// we are dealing with values that are known (at some higher level) to be of
/// a domain-over-composite type.  This is because tdtypeid/tdtypmod need to
/// match up with the type labeling of composite Datums, and those are never
/// explicitly marked as being of a domain type, either.
///
/// Tuple descriptors that live in caches (relcache or typcache, at present)
/// are reference-counted: they can be deleted when their reference count goes
/// to zero.  Tuple descriptors created by the executor need no reference
/// counting, however: they are simply created in the appropriate memory
/// context and go away when the context is freed.  We set the tdrefcount
/// field of such a descriptor to -1, while reference-counted descriptors
/// always have tdrefcount >= 0.
///
